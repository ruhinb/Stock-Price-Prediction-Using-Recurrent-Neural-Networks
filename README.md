# Stock Price Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks: A Comparative Study of RNN, LSTM, and GRU Models
In this study, I explored Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures, for predicting Google stock Adjusted Close prices. Using historical data spanning nearly two decades (2004–2023), I compared the performance of these models. The GRU model, optimized with hyperparameters, achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.00177 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.04203 on the test dataset. It also captured overall price trends with a Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) of 48.61\%, outperforming the baseline Simple RNN and LSTM models. However, the GRU’s MDA highlighted challenges in predicting directional changes. Hyperparameter optimization reduced the validation loss to 0.000147, enhancing model performance and generalization. These findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning models for stock price forecasting and provide insights into selecting appropriate architectures. Future work may integrate additional features and explore ensemble models for improved predictive accuracy.
